PCP (Performance Co-Pilot)

Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) provides a framework and services to
support system-level performance monitoring and management. 
It presents a unifying abstraction for all of the performance data
in a system, and many tools for interrogating, retrieving and 
processing that data
PCP is a feature-rich, mature, extensible, cross-platform toolkit
supporting both live and retrospective analysis.
The distributed PCP architecture makes it especially useful for those
seeking centralized monitoring of distributed processing.

POST-INSTALL:
============
By default the pmie, pmwebd and pmproxy startup scripts 

/etc/rc.d/rc.pmie
/etc/rc.d/rc.pmwebd
/etc/rc.d/rc.pmproxy

are disabled (no executable permissions are set). To enable any of them,
chmod 755 the corresponding startup script. In short: 

rc.pcp - starts all the agents and daemons for collecting the info from 
         various host monitoring 
rc.pmie - starts all daemons for evaluating the rules based on the exported 
          PCP metrics (usually for triggering particular events)
rc.pmwebd - starts the web daemon (JSON web requests for the pmcd daemon)
rc.pmproxy - starts proxy daemon (proxies requests for the pmcd daemon)
